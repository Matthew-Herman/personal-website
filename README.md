# personal-website
The purpose of this repository is to host my personal website and distribute the code freely. 

The aim of this website is to act as a kind of portfolio and personal website that displays my projects and career related information in an aestheically pleasing way.

The website is initially made using Bootstrap and I plan to add more features later according to my needs, which might require using different technologies.
